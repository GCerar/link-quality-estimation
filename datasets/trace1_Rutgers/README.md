# Dataset - Rutgers University

**Traceset of RSSI measurement from the ORBIT testbed.**

This traceset includes received signal strength indication (RSSI) for each correctly received frame at receiving nodes when various levels of noise are injected into the ORBIT testbed.

        Transforms traces from <i>data/</i> directory into flat structured, where missing sequence numbers are added, but no interpolation is performed. The output files reside in <i>${PROJECT_ROOT}/featureGenerator/datasets/dataset-2-rutgers-wifi/</i> in a comma-separated values (CSV) format. All CSV files contain these six columns with respective data types:
        <ul>
          <li>seq (sequence number) as <i>uint16</i> type</li>
          <li>src (source/transmitter node) as <i>string</i> type</li>
          <li>dst (destination/receiver node) as <i>string</i> type</li>
          <li>noise (artificial noise level) as <i>int8</i> type</li>
          <li>received (packet reception) as <i>boolean</i> type</li>
          <li>rssi (Reception Signal Strength Indicator) as <i>float32</i> type</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>interpolation.py</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        It applies desired interpolation onto each CSV file in <i>${PROJECT_ROOT}/featureGenerator/datasets/dataset-2-rutgers-wifi/</i> on <strong>rssi</strong> column. Run script with `-h` or `--help` parameter for further instructions.
